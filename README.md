# Future Ready Talent Virtual Internship Project
## Project title : Dental Health Static website template
This is a static web application depoyled using Azure technology.
## Problem Statement   
This is a responsive website template that includes information about a dental clinic. This website includes home, about us, services, gallery, blog, contact us tabs, and a book now button for booking an appointment. This web application will help us to save time as we can book an appointment from anywhere. Clients will see previous patient reviews as well.
## Project Description 
It consists of three to four sections that are like home, about as, services, gallery, blog, and contact us, one can book an appointment by clicking on Book now button. I have used HTML5 and CSS these two coding languages to do this web application. And I have used Visual Studio code editor. The home page contains the general introduction of the clinic and information about the dentist. Next is the services tab which includes services offered in the clinic. Gallery and blog contain a snapshot of happy clients, some insides of the clinic, infrastructure, and laboratory. The blog tab contains the latest news, and the contact us tab contains an area to ask questions and click send button. This is a template of a website later one can clone and add the content according to their need.
